A diverging bar graph is a chart which can handle values which are both positive and negative. In this specific instance, it shows how the average amount of points scored deviates around the average. For this graph, the average is set at zero. Through this graph, it can be shown clearly how much data diverged from the mean point. Also, the graph utilizes color to emphasize different diverging levels. The darker the bar, the further from the middle point, and vice versa for the lighter color bars."
